## The Tidyverse

To `install` the tidyverse package use the code: `install.packages("tidyverse").`

```{r}
# loading the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)
```

We also installed other packages by typing in the console the following code:

`install.packages(c("arrow", "babynames", "curl", "duckdb", "gapminder", "ggrepel", "ggridges", "ggthemes", "hexbin", "janitor", "Lahman", "leaflet", "maps", "nycflights13", "openxlsx", "palmerpenguins", "repurrrsive", "tidymodels", "writexl"))`
